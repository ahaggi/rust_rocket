Quickstart

    Note: Rust provides three distribution channels for Rust: nightly, beta, and stable. Unstable features are only available on nightly Rust.

    Before you can start writing a Rocket application, you'll need a nightly version of Rust installed. 
        1- If Rust default is already installed, use the tool rustup:
            "$ rustup default nightly"

            Running this command will install the nightly version of the tools (cargo, rustc, and so on). Also, it will switch the corresponding commands to use the nightly version.

            If you want to go back to the stable version, issue the following command:
                "$ rustup default stable"
        2- If Rust is not installed: Install Rust https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.2.0/book/installing-rust.html. 

    If you prefer, once we setup a project directory, you can use per-directory overrides to use the nightly version only for your Rocket project by running the following command:
        "cd path_to_some_project"
        "rustup override set nightly"

    The nightly version is updated very frequently, so you might want to update it every week or more often with the command:
        "$ rustup update"

    Warning: Rocket requires the latest version of Rust nightly.
            If your Rocket application suddenly stops building, ensure you're using the latest version of Rust nightly and Rocket by updating your toolchain and dependencies with:
                "rustup update && cargo update"



The absolute fastest way to start experimenting with Rocket is to clone the Rocket repository and run the included examples in the examples/ directory. For instance, the following set of commands runs the hello_world example:

    git clone https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket
    cd Rocket
    git checkout v0.4.2
    cd examples/hello_world
    cargo run



Creating a Project with Cargo
    1- Start by creating a new binary-based Cargo project and changing into the new directory.
        "cargo new hello-rocket --bin"  // --bin for binary-based
        "cd hello-rocket"
    2- add Rocket as a dependency in your Cargo.toml
        [dependencies]
        rocket = "x.x.x"
    3- Modify src/main.rs so that it contains the code for the Rocket.
        ...
    4- Ensure that nightly is the default OR use per-directory overrides to use the nightly version only for this project.
    5- Visit http://localhost:8000 to see your first Rocket application in action!
